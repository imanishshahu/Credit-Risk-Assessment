# 🧠 Credit Risk Assessment — Naive Bayes Classifier Explained

🔗 **Live Demo:** [credit-risk-assessment-theta.vercel.app](https://credit-risk-assessment-theta.vercel.app)

Welcome to an **interactive visual explainer** of the Gaussian Naive Bayes algorithm using a **credit risk classification** example. This tool is built to **educate**, **engage**, and **demystify** the inner workings of a fundamental machine learning model.

## 🎯 Project Goals

This project aims to:
- Teach **Gaussian Naive Bayes Classification** using interactive visualizations.
- Simulate how a model classifies a new applicant as **Low Risk** or **High Risk** based on:
  - Income
  - Credit Score
  - Loan Amount
- Provide both **visual intuition** and **mathematical understanding** behind the model.
